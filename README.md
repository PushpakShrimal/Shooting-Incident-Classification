# Shooting-Incident-Classification
An analysis of factors in U.S. shooting incidents to build a model that classifies fatality outcomes. This project demonstrates a full data science workflow, from EDA with Power BI to advanced techniques like SMOTE for handling imbalanced data.

## üìã Project Overview

This project uses machine learning to classify the outcome of shooting incidents as either **fatal** or **non-fatal**. By analyzing a dataset of incidents, this work aims to build a predictive model that can identify key factors contributing to fatalities. The project demonstrates a complete data science workflow, from data cleaning and exploratory analysis to handling imbalanced data and comparing multiple classification models.

## üìä The Dataset

The analysis is based on the `shootings.csv` dataset, which includes various attributes for each incident:
-   **Demographics:** `age`, `gender`, `race`
-   **Situational Factors:** `armed`, `threat_level`, `flee` status
-   **Procedural Details:** `body_camera` presence
-   **Outcome:** `manner_of_death` (used to engineer the binary `fatality` target variable)

### Key Challenge: Severe Class Imbalance

A critical aspect of this dataset is its severe class imbalance. **94.6%** of the incidents resulted in a fatality, while only **5.4%** were non-fatal. This imbalance poses a significant challenge, as a naive model could achieve high accuracy simply by always predicting "fatal." To build a meaningful classifier, this issue was addressed using the **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** on the training data.

The project was executed through a systematic pipeline:

1.  **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**
    -   Handled missing values in `armed`, `age`, `gender`, `race`, and `flee` by imputing with the mean or mode.
    -   Engineered time-based features (`year`, `month`, `day`) from the `date` column.
    -   Created the binary target variable `fatality` by mapping `shot` and `shot and Tasered` to 1 (fatal).

2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    -   Utilized **Power BI** for interactive dashboarding to explore trends and patterns visually.
    -   Used Python libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn) to plot distributions of key features like age, race, and threat level.

3.  **Feature Engineering & Scaling:**
    -   Converted categorical features to a numerical format using both **One-Hot Encoding** and **Label Encoding**.
    -   Scaled all numerical features using `StandardScaler` to ensure models were not biased by feature magnitudes.

4.  **Modeling & Evaluation:**
    -   Trained and compared three different classification models:
        -   Logistic Regression
        -   K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
        -   **Random Forest Classifier**
    -   Evaluated models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, focusing on performance for the minority (non-fatal) class.

## üèÜ Results: Random Forest as the Top Performer

After addressing the class imbalance with SMOTE, the **Random Forest Classifier** emerged as the best-performing model. It achieved an outstanding **accuracy of 98%** on the test set and demonstrated a strong ability to correctly identify both fatal and non-fatal incidents, as shown by its balanced precision and recall scores.

**Confusion Matrix for Random Forest Model:**

| Model                     | Accuracy | Recall (Class 0) | Precision (Class 0) | F1-Score (Class 0) |
| ------------------------- | :------: | :--------------: | :-----------------: | :----------------: |
| Logistic Regression       |  74.0%   |       0.79       |        0.18         |       0.29         |
| K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) |  94.0%   |       0.84       |        0.47         |       0.60         |
| **Random Forest** | **98.0%**|     **0.84** |      **0.77** |     **0.80** |

## üìä Power BI Dashboard

An interactive dashboard was created in Power BI to provide a high-level overview of the dataset. It allows for dynamic exploration of trends across different states, races, and threat levels. The `.pbix` file is available in the `/dashboard` directory.
